# CSR2 EF Cars
CSR2 Extra Fusion Cars

BAN WARNING

Only Elite Customs Cars can work with EF and they can only be used in Showdowns.
 I will be renaming the car file names EF for cars with added fusions/evo for better naming conventions.
 
 See: How_To_Extra_Fusions folder to learn how to EF almost any car. (Excludes some Legends, T5 with 150, and Tuners)
